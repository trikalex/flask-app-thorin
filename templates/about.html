<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770.
            While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in
            the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
            Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground
            as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin.

        <h3>Gloin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
            named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs
            which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
            Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was
            captured and lost.

            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied
            Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

        <h3>Ori</h3>
        <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and
            Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo
            Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug.
            Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which
            he survived.

        <p>
            Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori.
            In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in
            search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

            Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them.
            Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in
            Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of Durin.
            Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his
            family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in
            exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his
            halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's
            line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
            somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some
            fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and
            Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey,
            Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

        <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
        <p>
            Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in the
            year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.
            In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named
            Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.
            As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf,
            took interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember
            Gandalf's firework displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently
            practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he
            bent down to pick up a rock.

        <h3>Gandalf</h3>
        <p>
            Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before the
            Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his
            "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light
            and fire, much like Varda[3], yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience.
            He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in
            their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on
            the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.
